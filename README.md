1. Data Preparation:
using pandas to read csv and view dataset shape and columns.
create new dataset using relevant features and target variable for the present task.
3. Data Visualization:
check datatypes in case there is need for encoding categorical values.
check for missing values and duplicate rows.
check correlation coefficient of features to the target variable using seaborn.
create new dataset using highly correlated features.
4. Model Training:
split data into training and test sets using scikit-learn.
create linear regression model from the data.
check model summary (coefficients and r-squared value).
5. Model Evaluation:
use the model to create predictions.
compare predictions to test set values using matplotlib.
use r2_score from scikit-learn to check model accuracy.
6. Model Explanation:
explanation for model's predictions and accuracy.
